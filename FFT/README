There's a bunch of garbage files in here to clean out... but the important ones are:
readWav.h
readWav.cpp
runTestReadWav.cpp

I've been compiling with:
g++ readWav.cpp runTestReadWav.cpp /home/alex/kiss_fft130/kiss_fft.c /home/alex/kiss_fft130/tools/kiss_fftr.c -o readWav -I/home/alex/FFT/ -I/home/alex/kiss_fft130 -g

But there will have to be changes to make it work on your computers because I hard coded the file paths.
